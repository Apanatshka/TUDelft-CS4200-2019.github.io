## Contact

Lectures and lab sessions are natural points of contacts with instructors and teaching assistants. For short questions, Twitter works pretty well. Handling questions by e-mail is very inefficient, why we try to avoid it as much as possible. For longer discussions, we prefer appointments. To make an appointment, please send me an email with

* a detailed description of your problem: Where are you struggling? What questions do you have? How can I help you?
* some alternative dates: We prefer appointments in the morning. Keep in mind that we will need some time to prepare the appointment.

You will receive an email with

* some tasks for you to prepare the appointment,
* the date of our appointment, which you are asked to confirm.
