In this section of the course we look at control- and data-flow analysis techniques. These are analyses that take the abstract syntax tree produced by a parser and perform (context-sensitive) analyses of properties of a program.

Topics

  - data-flow analysis
    - control-flow, data-flow
    - monotone frameworks, worklist algorithm

Lectures

- [Data-Flow Analysis](dataflow-analysis)
- [Monotone Frameworks](monotone-frameworks)
