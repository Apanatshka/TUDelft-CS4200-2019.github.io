## Further Reading

1. Gabriël D. P. Konat, Lennart C. L. Kats, Guido Wachsmuth, Eelco Visser. [Declarative Name Binding and Scope Rules](http://researchr.org/publication/KonatKWV12). Software Language Engineering, SLE 2012   This paper introduces NaBL, a declarative language for describing the name binding and scoping rules of programming languages. While the language is being replaced by the next generation NaBL2 in Spoofax, it is still an instructive read, not in the least since the NaBL design is arguably more elegant than NaBL2 (but less expressive).

   This paper outlines the vision of a language designer's workbench that allows the description of a language design using high-level declarative meta-languages, which are used to derive implementations of various artifacts such as IDEs and interpreters, and are also the source for verification of safety properties. The paper also introduces the TS language for specification of type system rules to complement NaBL name binding rules.3. Pierre Néron, Andrew Tolmach, Eelco Visser, Guido Wachsmuth. [A Theory of Name Resolution](http://researchr.org/publication/NeronTVW15). ESOP 2015    This award winning paper introduces scope graphs for describing the binding and scoping facts of programs. A resolution calculus describes how references resolve to declarations in terms of a reachability and visibility relation. A resolution algorithm is shown to be sound and complete with respect to the calculus.     4. Hendrik van Antwerpen, Pierre Neron, Andrew P. Tolmach, Eelco Visser, Guido Wachsmuth. [A Constraint Language for Static Semantic Analysis based on Scope Graphs](http://researchr.org/publication/AntwerpenNTVW16). PEPM 2016
    This paper introduces a constraint language for name and type analysis based on scope graphs and a resolution algorithm. This is the basis for the design of the NaBL2 language. The paper coins the term 'type-dependent name resolution' to characterize resolutions that interact with type analysis.
