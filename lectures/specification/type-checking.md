1. Pierre NeÃÅron, Andrew Tolmach, Eelco Visser, Guido Wachsmuth. [A Theory of Name Resolution](http://researchr.org/publication/NeronTVW15). ESOP 2015    This award winning paper introduces scope graphs for describing the binding and scoping facts of programs. A resolution calculus describes how references resolve to declarations in terms of a reachability and visibility relation. A resolution algorithm is shown to be sound and complete with respect to the calculus.     2. Hendrik van Antwerpen, Pierre Neron, Andrew P. Tolmach, Eelco Visser, Guido Wachsmuth. [A Constraint Language for Static Semantic Analysis based on Scope Graphs](http://researchr.org/publication/AntwerpenNTVW16). PEPM 2016
    This paper introduces a constraint language for name and type analysis based on scope graphs and a resolution algorithm. This is the basis for the design of the NaBL2 language. The paper coins the term 'type-dependent name resolution' to characterize resolutions that interact with type analysis.
