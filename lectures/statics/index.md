In this section of the course we look at static analysis of programs. These are analyses that take the abstract syntax tree produced by a parser and perform (context-sensitive) analyses of properties of a program.

Topics

  - static semantics and type checking
    - name binding, name resolution, scope graphs
    - types, type checking, type inference, subtyping
    - unification, constraints
  - semantic editor services
  - Data-flow analysis
    - control-flow, data-flow
    - monotone frameworks, worklist algorithm
