Lectures are organised in four parts. The first part introduces software languages in general and imperative and object-oriented languages in particular.

The second part focuses on declarative specification of compiler components as supported by state-of-the-art tools for compiler construction, including lexical syntax, context-free syntax, static semantics, and code generation.

In the third part, we address techniques for the compilation and runtime environments of imperative and object-oriented languages, including activation records, memory management, register allocation, and optimisation techniques in detail.

In the final part, we take a closer look on the inside working of compiler components and their generators. In particular, we study parsing algorithms and parser generation.
