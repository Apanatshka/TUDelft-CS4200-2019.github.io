In the opening lecture we look at what compilers are, why you would want to study them, and how the course is organized.

[Draft slides](https://github.com/TUDelft-CS4200-2018/lectures/blob/master/01-introduction/CS4200-2018-1-introduction.pdf)

The lecture discusses the traditional compiler pipeline. In the course we will be using a language workbench (Spoofax to be precise) to define and implement languages. The following paper describes the design of Spoofax. Read it and make the corresponding [homework assignment](/assignments/week1.1/).
