# Installation

##### How can I disable the cygwin warnings about paths when building on Windows?

1. Add a system [environment variable](http://superuser.com/questions/284342/what-are-path-and-other-environment-variables-and-how-can-i-set-or-use-them) 
   called `CYGWIN` with the value `nodosfilewarning`. 
2. Restart eclipse.

# Testing Syntax Definition

##### How do I get started?

1. Create a Spoofax editor project ([instructions](https://github.com/TUDelft-IN4303/assignments/tree/master/milestone1-editor#initial-spoofax-project)) 
   and a test project ([instructions](https://github.com/TUDelft-IN4303/assignments/tree/master/milestone1-editor#initial-test-project)) in Eclipse.
2. Create a new test suite in the test project. 
   1. Select *File > New > File* from the menu.
   2. Use `.spt` as a file extension.
3. Write your first test module in that file. 
   
Each test module gets its own file. 
You can add directories to your project to group the test files. 
If you build the editor project, your test modules will be parsed. 

# Syntax Definition

##### Should I use templates?

Yes. 
This will save you several hours of work in the next assignment.

##### Is it possible to split my syntax definition up in several files possibly in subfolders?

Yes that is possible. You can have the following directory tree for example:

    syntax/
      subdir/
        c.sdf3
      b.sdf3
      MyLanguage.sdf3

`MyLanguage.sdf3` should have the following imports if it depends on `b` and `c`:

    module MyLanguage
     
    imports 
      b 
      subdir/c
    
and `c` should be declared as

    module subdir/c
    
If you get errors while you think you shouldn't, open all `.sdf3` files and run *Generate SDF (concrete, for selection)* from the *Transform* button. If this does not result in a corresponding `.sdf` file, something is wrong in your `.sdf3` file.

##### Why does the `bracket` attribute has no effect?

You probably used a constructor name together with the `bracket` attribute.
This is a mistake.

##### Why are my `context-free priorities` not translated into SDF2?

There is an error in these priorities, which causes the generator to fail.
You probably made a typo in a constructor name. 

##### Why does Eclipse become unresponsive when I open or run test files?

There is very likely an error in your rules for `LAYOUT`. 
Study the rules found on the slides or in the generated `Common.sdf3` in a new language project.
Fixing these issues should make running your tests way faster.

##### Why do I get a StackOverflowException and how should I handle this?

This is also very likely caused by erroneous rules for `LAYOUT`. 

1. Close Eclipse. 
2. Delete all files in the `include` folder in your MiniJava project.
3. Fix the erroneous rules.
4. Build your project.

##### Why am I getting a *Builder failed* error when I click *Show desugared syntax*?

You probably do not have a snippet of code selected that can be transformed by the `desugar` rule, thereby causing the `editor-desugar` rule to fail.
If you select an expression and run *Show desugared syntax*, you will see the output of `desugar` applied to that expression.
Alternatively, you could edit the `editor-desugar` rule to apply the `desugar-all` strategy to transform the complete AST of your MiniJava file.
