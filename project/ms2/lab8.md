This lab is under construction. Proceed at own risk.
{: .notice .notice-warning}

In this lab, you define a simple data-flow analysis for MiniJava in FlowSpec. The concepts you are going to use in FlowSpec are described in the following paper:

- Jeff Smits, Eelco Visser. FlowSpec: declarative dataflow analysis specification. In Beno√Æt Combemale, Marjan Mernik, Bernhard Rumpe, editors, Proceedings of the 10th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Software Language Engineering, SLE 2017, Vancouver, BC, Canada, October 23-24, 2017. pages 221-231, ACM, 2017.

## Overview

### Objectives

Specify data-flow analysis for MiniJava in FlowSpec. The specification should include:

...

### Submission

You need to submit your MiniJava project with a merge request against branch `assignment-8-submission` on GitLab.
The [Git documentation](/documentation/git.html#submitting-an-assignment) explains how to file such a request.

The deadline for submission is December 1, 2018.

### Grading

You can earn up to 100 points for the correctness of your data-flow analysis.

### Early Feedback

We provide early feedback for your language implementation. This feedback gives you an indication
which parts of your name and type analysis might still be wrong. It includes a summary on how many
tests you pass and how many points you earn by passing them. You have 3 early feedback attempts.

## Detailed Instructions

### Git Repository

You continue with your work from the previous assignment.
See the [Git documentation](/documentation/git.html#continue-from-previous-assignment) on how to create the
`assignment-8-develop` branch from your previous work.
